This program is to run a PLC unit
P1AM-200
There are: 
2 pumps with flow sensors
9 tanks with:
  1 fill valve each
  1 green light each
  1 HH switch each
  1 EPO each
  1 4-20mA level sensor each
  1 red light each


First step is to get the pumps to run in a lead lag not based on time but running instanses. 
then it is on to running a fail safe for if a pump does not start.
